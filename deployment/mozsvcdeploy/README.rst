PiCL Server Deployment Management Thingo
========================================

This is an experiment in automating deployment of picl-server into in AWS.
It basically wraps CloudFormation with some handy shortcuts and management
scripts.

IT IS NOT COMPLETE AND DOESNT WORK YET.

You'll need the "boto" library and your AWS access credentials set up as
environment variables.
